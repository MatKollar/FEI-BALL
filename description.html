        This game was inspired by DX-Ball. It is a brick-breaking game where the
        player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and bounces a ball
        off of it to break bricks at the top of the screen. The game could have
        different levels with increasing difficulty. The game is created using
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and could be played through a web browser.
